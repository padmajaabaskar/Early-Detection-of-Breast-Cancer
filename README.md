Micro-calcifications are one of the key indicators of early breast cancer in mammograms. Our aim  is to identify the specific attributes in the mammography images that are specifically related to the suspicious images in the early detection of breast cancer. This method uses a region-based segmentation for acquiring the region of interest and a novel classification method to reduce the false positives of the diagnosis.
