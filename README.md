This project presents a novel approach for the early detection of breast cancer through the identification and analysis of micro-calcifications in mammographic images. Micro-calcifications are among the earliest indicators of breast carcinoma and their accurate detection plays a pivotal role in effective diagnosis and prognosis. Given the subtle and often ambiguous nature of these calcifications, traditional manual analysis methods are prone to errors and subjectivity. Therefore, the focus of this project is to develop a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system that can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of early breast cancer screening by automating the detection and classification of these critical features.

The methodology adopted in this work begins with the preprocessing of raw mammograms to improve image quality and standardize intensity levels across samples. Noise is suppressed using spatial filtering techniques, and contrast enhancement is applied to ensure that micro-calcifications, which are typically small and bright, are distinguishable from surrounding tissue. Following preprocessing, a region-based segmentation algorithm is employed to isolate potential regions of interest (ROIs) that may contain micro-calcifications. This segmentation is critical as it narrows down the spatial search area, allowing the classifier to focus only on the most relevant parts of the image.

Once the regions of interest are extracted, a set of discriminative features are computed to characterize the localized textures, intensities, and shapes associated with calcified regions. These features are designed to capture both morphological and statistical properties of the segmented areas. The feature vectors are then passed to a custom classification framework designed to distinguish between benign and malignant regions. This classifier has been optimized to reduce the incidence of false positives, which is a common challenge in CAD systems for breast cancer. The model was trained and validated using publicly available, annotated mammographic datasets such as DDSM and INbreast, ensuring that the evaluation is benchmarked against clinically relevant and standardized data.

The system demonstrates robust performance in detecting suspicious micro-calcifications, achieving high sensitivity while significantly reducing false alarms. This balance is essential in clinical settings, where minimizing both missed diagnoses and unnecessary biopsies is crucial. The results indicate that the proposed hybrid method—combining region-based segmentation with a carefully tuned classification model—can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool, aiding radiologists in early-stage breast cancer detection.

In the long term, this work lays the foundation for deploying deep learning-based extensions and integrating explainability modules to improve model transparency and clinical trust. The pipeline is designed with scalability in mind, allowing future integration with real-time mammography screening workflows and cloud-based medical imaging platforms. Through this research, we aim to contribute toward the advancement of non-invasive, data-driven solutions in medical imaging, particularly in the domain of women’s health and early cancer detection.
